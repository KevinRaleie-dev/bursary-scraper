# Bursary Web Scraper 🕷

I built a simple script for fetching / scraping closing bursaries for the month of September 2021 for my girlfriend.

Its pretty basic but gets the job done. Might convert this over to an API.

<b>Update:</b>
Converted the script into an API. Will be building a frontend to integrate with it.

### Built with 🧑🏽‍💻:

> Node.js, cheerio, axios, express

- ```yarn install``` installs dependencies

- ```yarn start``` to run

- ```yarn lint:fix``` to lint and fix eslint rules
